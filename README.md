# AirCard for macOS 12 & 13 🎴

> **Apple Wallet Card Skinner & Lockscreen Passcode Themer for iOS 18+ (No Jailbreak Required)**  
> **Tracks the latest upstream AirCard releases while preserving macOS 12 Monterey and macOS 13 Ventura support.**
> **Upstream is tested on iOS 27; compatibility-build hardware coverage is documented per release.**
> Powered by the `airlift` AirTraffic sync exploit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an independently maintained compatibility fork of [Mak5er/AirCard](https://github.com/Mak5er/AirCard). The application remains `AirCard.app`; this repository maintains the additional deployment and API compatibility needed by macOS 12 and macOS 13 on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Installation

### macOS (Universal DMG)
1. Download **`AirCard.dmg`** from [Releases](https://github.com/tinymins/AirCard-macOS12-13/releases).
2. Open `AirCard.dmg` and drag **`AirCard.app`** into your **Applications** folder.
3. The compatibility build supports macOS 12 Monterey, macOS 13 Ventura, and newer macOS versions on both **Apple Silicon** and **Intel (x86)** Macs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Python 3 requirement:** The current compatibility build uses an installed Python 3 runtime. If `python3 --version` is unavailable, run `xcode-select --install` before launching AirCard. A bundled runtime may be added in a future compatibility release.

> [!NOTE]
> **First Launch on macOS (Gatekeeper):**
> If macOS displays an unidentified developer prompt on first launch:
> - **Method 1 (UI):** Right-click (or Control-click) `AirCard.app` in Applications ➔ click **Open** ➔ click **Open**.
> - **Method 2 (Terminal):**
>   ```sh
>   sudo xattr -cr /Applications/AirCard.app
>   ```

## How to Customize Apple Wallet Cards
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB cable and ensure it is unlocked and trusted.
2. In AirCard, stay on the **Wallet Cards** tab and click **Scan Cards**.
3. On your iPhone:
   - **Double-click the Side (Power) button** to open Apple Pay.
   - Authenticate with **Face ID**.
   - **Tap your card** (or tap it once more) to trigger instant detection!
4. Click on any card mockup or drag & drop an image directly onto the card.
5. Click **Flash Skins**.
6. Force-close the **Wallet** app on your iPhone from the App Switcher (or reboot) to see your new custom card design!

### If scanning finds no cards

The scanner uses the iPhone's unified log service, including Info/Debug events.
On iOS 18.6.2, the legacy log service can show Wallet activity while omitting the
resource lookup messages that contain card identifiers.

Open **Log** and check for `Connected to the unified device log stream`, then
double-click the side button, authenticate, and tap or switch cards. If the log
reader stops, reconnect and unlock the iPhone, then start another scan. Values
that iOS replaces with `<private>` cannot be recovered by the scanner.

If your device previously connected but scanning found zero cards, please try
this build and report whether it helps. Include your iPhone model, iOS version,
macOS version, and the AirCard version or commit tested. Avoid posting full
device logs or card identifiers. See [scanner validation](docs/wallet-card-detection.md)
for the verified environment and remaining coverage.

## How to Apply Lockscreen Passcode Themes (.passthm)
1. Switch to the **Passcode Themes** tab at the top of AirCard.
2. Drag & drop any `.passthm` file into the app (or click **Choose .passthm File**).
3. AirCard will inspect the theme and display an interactive preview on the numeric keypad (0–9, *, #).
4. Click **Apply Passcode Theme**.
5. Restart your iPhone to reload the lock screen cache and see your custom passcode buttons!

> [!TIP]
> **Universal Language & Bold Text Support:**  
> AirCard automatically expands and flashes custom keypad assets for all system locales (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Spanish, German, French, etc.) and generates both standard and **Bold Text** cache bitmaps (`--white` and `--white-bold`), ensuring your theme works regardless of your iOS language or accessibility display settings!

## Building from Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tinymins/AirCard-macOS12-13.git
cd AirCard-macOS12-13
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
This builds universal binaries (`arm64` + `x86_64`), bundles the project scripts and native helpers into `build/AirCard.app`, and outputs `build/AirCard.dmg`.

## Compatibility & Upstream Policy

- Follow current releases and relevant fixes from [Mak5er/AirCard](https://github.com/Mak5er/AirCard).
- Preserve macOS 12 Monterey and macOS 13 Ventura deployment compatibility when adopting upstream changes.
- Keep the application name, bundle identifier, data format, and user workflow aligned with upstream unless compatibility requires a documented difference.
- Validate each compatibility release as a Universal build and publish any hardware, iOS, Python, signing, or runtime limitations in its release notes.
